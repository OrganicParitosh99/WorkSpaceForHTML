            <dt>Simple</dt>
            <dd>Java is very easy to learn.Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:

                Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
                Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
                There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.
                </dd>
                <hr>
            <dt>Object-Oriented</dt>
            <dd>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize
                 our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.</dd>
                 <hr>
            <dt>Platform independent/dt>
            <dd>Java is platform independent because it 
                is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, 
                run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.</dd>
                <hr>

            <dt>Secured</dt>
            <dd>Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:

                No explicit pointer
                Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
                </dd>
              <hr>
            <dt>Robust</dt>
            <dd>The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because:

                It uses strong memory management.
                There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
                Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.
                There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points make Java robust.
                </dd>
                <hr>
            <dt>Architecture-neutral</dt>
            <dd>Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.

                In C programming, int data type 
                occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. 
                However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.</dd>
                <hr>
            <dt>Portable</dt>
            <dd>Java is portable because it 
                facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.</dd>
                <hr>
            <dt>High-performance</dt>
            <dd>ava is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++).
                 Java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled languages, e.g., C, C++, etc.</dd>
